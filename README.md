# Lead-Qualifier-with-Airtable-integration
This project is an AI-driven lead classification and entity extraction tool designed to streamline real estate workflows. It uses Cohere's  (LLMs) to classify leads and extract structured information (location, intent, budget) from free-text messages. The processed leads are saved in a CSV file and automatically pushed to an Airtable base.
